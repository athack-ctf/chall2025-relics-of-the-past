Do you know Git? If you really do, you should be able to put together the flag, since it was fragmented in 5 parts and placed at different locations in this git repo.

Recover all parts, put them back together in the correct order, and get the complete flag.

Notes:
 - Part format: `PART<idx>:<PART_VALUE>`.
 - Only `<PART_VALUE>` is used for combining the flag.
 - Flag format: `ATHACKCTF{PART1|PART2|...|PART5}`
