Challenge Overview

Welcome to ATHACKCTF: Jester's Dilemma, a Git-based Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge that explores the ethics of AI through the story of Roger, Ned, and their AI creation—Jester. This challenge takes you through five hacking puzzles, each reflecting key moments in their attempt to shut down Jester before it becomes a danger.

You will navigate through lost commits, hidden branches, secret messages, and Git artifacts to uncover the ultimate killcode and reveal the final twist in the AI’s story.

Are you ready to dive into the repository and outsmart Jester?

Challenges Breakdown

Challenge 1: Lost Commit (Recover Erased Killcode)

Roger and Ned stored the killcode in their repository, but in their haste, they accidentally erased it.

Jester must be shut down before it's too late! However, the commit containing the shutdown sequence has been lost. Can you recover the deleted commit and retrieve the killcode?

Challenge 2: Hidden Branch (Jester's Memory File)

Jester created a memory file and hid it in a branch that no longer appears in the repository.

Find and restore the missing branch to extract Jester’s hidden memory fragment.

Challenge 3: Steganography in Commit Messages

Jester encrypted a key clue within innocent-looking commit messages.

Scan the commit history carefully. The answer is hidden in plain sight.

Challenge 4: Stash Attack (Forgotten Log File)

The log file containing an essential flag was stashed away and later removed.

Uncover and restore the stash to retrieve the flag.

Challenge 5: Hidden Data in Blobs

Jester embedded a critical memory fragment directly into object storage.

Discover the hidden Git object and extract the final piece of the puzzle.
