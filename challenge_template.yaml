		Do you know Git? If you really do, you should be able to put together the flag, since it was fragmented in 5 parts and placed at different locations in this git repo.

        Recover all parts, put them back together in the correct order, and get the complete flag.

        Notes:
            - Part format: `PART<idx>:<PART_VALUE>` (e.g., `PART1:SECRET`).
            - Only `<PART_VALUE>` (`SECRET` in the example) is used for combining the flag.
            - Flag format: `ATHACKCTF{PART1|PART2|...|PART5}`
